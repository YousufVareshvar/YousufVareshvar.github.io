     <p>In simple words, a flood is the overflow of water which submerges dry lands. They are a frequent type of natural disaster and they are caused mainly by excess rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a surge from a cyclone or tsunami. It can also be caused by the overflow of inland waters or tidal waters, or by an unusual accumulation of water. There are many different types of floods. River floods are caused when consistent rain or snow melt forces a river to exceed capacity. Coastal floods are caused by storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and tsunami.</p>

     <p>Since, in  recent months, the cases of floods have increased, we should take measures to decrease the frequency of them by:
    <ol>
    <li>Creating sponge cities, which are a new urban construction model for flood management and strengthening ecological infrastructure, as proposed by Kongjian Yu.</li>
    <li>Introduce better flood warning systems.</li>
    <li>Building better dams which can hold more water</li>
    <li>Increase spending on flood defenses</li>
    </ol>
   And lastly, spreading awareness about floods and their impact on the world.
